C is procedural language
number of objects can be created in any object oriented programming
A class is the blueprint from which specific objects are created

for creating instance for a class
<reference name> = <className>()

for creating class methods we need to send self as a default parameter to access the class variables in the def/methods
class<className>
    def<methodName>(self,<other parameters>)
    <method body>

in init program if we didnot assign any values while calling the fn then the defaault value which is assigned at the inti methos is taaken
